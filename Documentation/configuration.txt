Plan on 2019-03-05
1. Related to history:
+ Adding columns:
Date_Open - date when object added to DB
Date_Update - this column will be updated in next days where script is running in case 'SKIPP'
Date_Close - will be updated on the end of script for these rows where Date_Update is earler than script start.
Active - field with values:
    O - just opened
    U - updated - means that object already at least 2nd day
    C - closed
History statistic than can be calculated by following way:
- TargetDay between Date_Open and Date_Close

2. Create column 'object_id' -> and realize correct inserting
+ updated old rows


3. Update to reflect:
+ Date_Open - date when object added to DB
+ Date_Update - this column will be updated in next days where script is running in case 'SKIPP'
+ Date_Close - will be updated on the end of script for these rows where Date_Update is earler than script start.
+ Final update - all records that were not updated (SKIPPED or new INSERTED) set as CLOSED


4. Fix:
+ fixed all times, covert to one format: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
+ fix sub-region in case it doesn't exist (not Praha, Brno...)

5. Feature:
+ Byty_Pronajem

6. Check ticks (on some fields are tick, not text)

7. Fix:
- fix reconnect on each new Page for Prodej

8.
+ Add dataloadlogid for each loading
+ Fix closing - to close only not-closed items!

9. Domy:
- Prodej
- Pronajem
